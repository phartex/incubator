              The enormous challenges encountered by startups especially during
              the formative stage which include access to seed fund, business
              information and mentorship prove an arduous task. When confronted
              by these challenges, rather than taking the bold step to start a
              business, many youths, while asking the question “what is the
              point?” eventually settle for job employment.

              Considering that the Nigerian economy will be impacted by the
              profitability of businesses, much has to be done to encourage
              startups and facilitate their growth, both at the state and
              federal levels.

              Nigeria has what it takes to export innovation given her myriad of
              talented youths. However, the absence of collaboration between the
              government and private investors result into a myopia of business
              insight and risk-aversion invariably hindering startups from its
              launch.

              Seed fund, which is the core of start-ups is almost non-existent
              or inaccessible to new business entrants in Nigeria. While seed
              fund is considered in other nations as a way to grow new business
              ideas, its success is showcased in the Western world where
              appetite for investment is huge. This therefore accounts for why
              many businesses and innovations emerge at every turn.

              The Nigerian government has a vital role to play in encouraging
              startups because a lot more can be achieved through access to
              grants and seed funding for quick transformation and growth.
              Similarly, lessons can be learnt from the Singaporean community
              that encourages startups’ growth and expansion through seed
              funding and mentorship. The Incubator Reality will engage and
              invest in start-ups, from inception to seed stage, launch and
              growth.

              According to PitchBook, a private market data company, there were
              382,000 business births in the UK in 2017, which equates to a 13%
              birthrate with seed from crowdfunding, venture capitals and
              peer-to-peer lending.

              An overview of venture capital deals in the UK in 2017 based on
              the gender of the founding team shows that less than 1% went to
              female-only teams, 10% went to teams with mixed genders and 89%
              went to male-only teams. In comparison with the UK, the Toronto
              community in Canada had an estimate of 2,100 to 2,700 startups

              As at 2020, VC funding in Africa dropped by 40% with both early
              stage and pre-stage funding setback due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
              However, before the outbreak of the pandemic, the Small Business
              Administration (SBA) posits that one in three small businesses in
              Nigeria fold up within 18 months of establishment. To add to this,
              data for the last decade revealed that Nigeria has a failure rate
              of 61% for startups. These failures stem from inaccessible seed
              funds and loans from financial institutions, mismanagement of seed
              funds where provided and inadequate business resources and
              mentorship.

              If transformation must occur in the creative industry and within
              startups, the government must make funds available to the public
              from local to federal levels. Funds such as grants and seed
              funding for startups will go a long way in changing the narrative
              in order to overcome the challenges.

              2. Why are you in the business? <br />
              3. How much information do you have about the business you want to
              start? What sources do you derive your information from? <br />
              4. Does your business satisfy any need? <br />
              5. What kind of risk are you willing to take on the business?
              <br />
              6. Will your business be scalable? <br />
