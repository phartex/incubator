              With reference and acknowledgement to the great capital city of
              the old western region – Ibadan’s entrepreneurial successes as
              well as its influence in the scheme of national and continental
              growth and economic development can never be said to be in doubt.
              The city, alongside up to nine innovative developments, have
              emanated from Nigeria and Africa which made it a proud pacesetter.
              Pertinent to clarify that, the pacesetter status of Ibadan dates
              back to the early development of the municipal status of the town.

              Today, by virtue of the colonial decision in the pre-Independence
              days, which conferred that special status – Ibadan became
              Nigeria’s premier university town. Because the university in
              Ibadan was the first and for several years the only one in the
              entire country, it assembled its scholars from all over the world
              and became a truly nationalist melting pot.

              The importance of such a place in national historical evolution
              cannot be underestimated. The country’s first indigenous academics
              - the men and women who formed the country’s first professional,
              administrative, business, economy and academic elites were trained
              here. And it is this fortuitous role, as a nursery of a national
              clientele, a role which it has happily continued to maintain that
              has helped give Ibadan its distinctive and unique character among
              the towns and cities in Nigeria. Therefore, we can proudly say,
              Ibadan was significant to why Nigeria is the giant of Africa.

              Most of these great developments are not famously attributed to
              Ibadan and its people because they are always at the receiving end
              of people regarding them as jesters. On the flip side, their
              accent and pronunciation of certain English words does not leave
              much room for defence but little do people know that Ibadan set
              the precedent for the good English we speak today as Nigerians.

              Ibadan people are creative in thoughts and actions which is
              portrayed in their popular slogan
              <em>“Ibadan lomo oomo layipo”</em>, which means
              <em> “you only know Ibadan, you don’t know layipo”</em>. What or
              who is layipo? A million-dollar question we should leave for

              Probably, Nigeria could have led the world in innovation if the
              Federal Capital Territory was moved from Lagos to Ibadan. If you
              are unconvinced, let us put our differences aside and focus on
              harnessing our potentials towards a common goal.

              We can harness our skills as a nation to be the pacesetter as well
              as begin exporting innovation and intellectual properties rather
              than importing them. This was what the great Ibadan entrepreneurs
              like the late Chief Bode Akindele of the Modandola Group of
              Companies typified for Ibadan and even beyond, to the world. But
              guess what, Ibadan in this reference is only a microcosm of the
              abundance of potentials that abound in both the larger Nigerian
              and African greatness that has been grossly untapped and utilized.

              Beyond anything as a nation and continent, our communication has
              to be seamless for us to start acknowledging and understanding
              each other’s skills. We can start by identifying skills in people
              and celebrating them rather than having the ‘crab’ mentality of
              pulling each other down.
